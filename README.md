Java Replay Debugger

Jink is an interactive tool for the visualization of the ex- ecution of a running Java program that allows interactive inspection of previous states of the program by “traveling backwards in time”. It offers the programmer 
(a) to interact with Java running objects (as well as with classes) by methods call, 
(b) to start new threads,
(c) to observe the in- terleaving of thread scheduling, and 
(d) to inspect objects fields as well as their evolution on the heap of the JVM.
